This software depends on a number of open-source projects available under
the APLv2 license, as well as their respective dependencies. However, 
we depend on hadoop-lzo which is under the GPLv3 and you should be aware of
the issue when it comes to distributing APLv2 and GPLv3 code.

The Free Software Foundation considers the Apache License, Version 2.0 to be a 
free software license, compatible with version 3 of the GPL. The Software Freedom Law Center 
provides practical advice for developers about including permissively licensed source.

Apache 2 software can therefore be included in GPLv3 projects, because the GPLv3 license 
accepts our software into GPLv3 works. However, GPLv3 software cannot be included in 
Apache projects. The licenses are incompatible in one direction only, and it is a 
result of ASF's licensing philosophy and the GPLv3 authors' interpretation of copyright law.

This licensing incompatibility applies only when some Apache project software becomes 
a derivative work of some GPLv3 software, because then the Apache software would have 
to be distributed under GPLv3. This would be incompatible with ASF's requirement that 
all Apache software must be distributed under the Apache License 2.0.

We avoid GPLv3 software because merely linking to it is considered by the GPLv3 
authors to create a derivative work. We want to honor their license. Unless 
GPLv3 licensors relax this interpretation of their own license regarding linking, 
our licensing philosophies are fundamentally incompatible. This is an identical 
issue for both GPLv2 and GPLv3.
